Ch. Intro, 1, 8, 17, 18 HTML and Ch. 1 JS

# Introduction
It is pretty much how a webpage is set up on how each of HTML, CSS, and JS play a part to see the web page. 

# Chapter 1
They begin to go over the structure of an HTML document along with a few common markdown tags. 

# Chapter 8
It stats to go over some topics we have covered in previous classes like **doctypes, comments, id, class, blocks, inline, span (is an inline div).

A new tag I see is the ```<iframe>```, which is like a little window that has been cut into your page (helpful for pictures or maps).

The ```<meta>``` tag lives in the ```<head>``` and contains information about the webpage that is not visible to others which helps the web search for your page. 
A meta tag can house description, keywords, robots (can use noindex or nofollow), author, pragma (caching the page), expiration. (see page 192)

Reference page 194 for some escape characters. 

# Chapter 17
This goes into some of the contents of an html document. A few new ones are:

```<aside>```
- If it is in the article tag then it could contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. (pullquote or glossary)

- If it is not in an article tag then it is a container for content that is related to teh entire page. (like links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, etc)

The ```<hgroup>``` tag is used to group together one or more h1-h6 tags and treats them as one single heading. 

# Chapter 18
A *site map* is a dagram that shows how the page can be grouped. 

*Card Sorting*: "involves placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to  lnow on a separate piece of paper and then organizing the related infromation into groups." 

## JS

# Chapter 1

For writing a script you should 
1. Define the goal
1. Design the script
1. Code each step

Each task can be broken down into a sequence of steps which can be trasnlated to a line of code. 

An *object* can have its own properties, events, and methods. 
- Each property has a name and a value and they tell you something about each instance of the object. 
- An event is the computers way of noticing something happened. 
- Methods represent how people interact with an object.
