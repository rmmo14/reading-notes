Html5 stoarege is a way to store key/value pairs locally in the client web browser. You store data based on a named key, retrieve it with the same key, the named key is a string. This is always a string, and if you want to use values as else then you will have to use JS. 

The localStorage object stores your information even if you get off the current page. It will remember all the values. Instead of refreshing and resetting all the values, it uses another function to if something previous is stored locally.
