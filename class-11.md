# Ch. 16, 19 HTML Reading Notes

## Ch.16 Images
Instead of using `align` attribute, some people use the float property. There are two ways:

1. float is added to the class created to size the Images
1. new classes such as align-left or right to align with respect to the page. It goes with the size of the images. 

In oder to align an image, first turn it into a block-level element with the display property. Then either:
- use text-align property with center
- use margin property on the image and set values to the left and right margins to auto

`background-image: url()` property is used to set an image as a background. 

`background-repeat:` can take the following properties: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat. They make images repeat vertically and horizontally, only horizontally, only vertically, or not repeat. 

You can create a button that changes when a user moves their mouse over it. Give both the (background) pictures the same class and that has three different styles of the same button.
