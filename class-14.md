# Article Notes on Teams

Many firms realized that "employee performance optimization" was not enough for teams. HBR has reported that collaborative activities have jumped by 50 percent or more. In the SV, engineers are encouraged to work together as it has been proven that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes faster, and find better solutions to problems. It has been shown that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. 

A few lines that stuck out to me are "It's netter to put introverts together". After so much research they noticed that what distinguished good teams versus bad ones was how the teammates treated each other. 

Something researchers noticed was members spoke in roughly the same proportion (equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking). If everyone spoke by the end of the day then teams were successful. Second, they noticed teams had high "average social sensitivity" meaning they understood how others felt by their tone of voice. 

Psychological safety "is a sense of confidence that the team will not embarras, rect, or punish someone for speaking up. Though it is not that easy to implement. 

"When companies try to optimize everything, it's sometimes easy to forget that success if oten built on experiences that can't be optimized".

# Transform Notes

The transform property uses multiple vendors to consider different browsers. 

Transform can rotoate degrees, scaling (can do both xy or just one), skew, and combine any transformations. 

The translate value works like relative positioning, and can target both xy or just one. 

To use 3D the elements need a prespective from which to transform (in px). Then combine them with any of the methods listed above. 

# Transition Notes

Transition takes on: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Animations work like these properties but goes a step further. 
1. Fade in
1. Change color
1. Grow and shrink
1. rotate elements
1. square to circle
1. 3d shadow
1. swing
1. inset border
