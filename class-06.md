## Article Notes
**Problem Domain** will be difficult! It is like solivng a jigsaw puzzle with no picture to reference. It is best to not assume you know the solution to every problem. It costs more to do the work again than to get it right the first time. 

## Ch. 3 pg 100-105

An **object** groups together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you could recognize from the real world. 

In an object: variables become known as *properties*, functions become known as *methods*. **Properties** tell us about the object, and **methods** represent tasks that are associated with the object. They both have a name and a value. In an object it is called a key. The value of a method is always a function. 

### Literal Notation
It is the way to create objects. Each key of an object is separated by a comma except the last value. 

* The `this ` keyword indicates that it is using the associate property of *this* object (the object it is within).

### Access an Object with Dot Notation
You can also access properties using square brackets. The "dot" is referred as the member operator. The property or method on its right is a member of the object on its left. ex: `var hotelName = hotel.name;` is the same as `var hotelName = hotel['name'];`
